arrays
pointers

aim - learn about pointers and their uses

crate an array of ints
fill with numbers -100 to 100
create an array of doubles
fill with numbers -100.0 to 100.0 in increments of 0.1
create an array of shorts - -100 to 100
create an array of chars and fill with lor-ipsom to 200 characters

research and  calculate the size of the
array using sizeof

int
double
char
small

use pointer arithmatic to show every other item in the array
use pointer arithmatic to show nth memory address

for each of the arrays show what the pointer++ is doing 

all the user to select every 2, every 3 etc, show 10, show 20, etc.

put the above tests into functions
Create a user menu system that allows a user to test various
array / pointer functions.
