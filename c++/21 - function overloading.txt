header guards
circular dependancies
malloc and free
heap and stack
pass in big data
time how long for 1MB char data in


OUTPUT:

  Worksheet catch up
  sit with students and worksheets
  see who has completed what




No one finished the worksheet on pointers
Maybe start on functions and pointers and parameters but simple stuff.
They need time to finish
